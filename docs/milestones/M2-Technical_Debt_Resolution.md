# Milestone: M2-Technical_Debt_Resolution ðŸ”§ [C]

**Parallel Track**: Core Development  
**Dependencies**: M1-MVP_Test_the_Hypothesis  
**Status**: DONE (2025-08-07)

## Overview
This milestone addressed critical technical debt from M1, primarily fixing the metrics integration between cc_wrapper.py and benchmark.py to ensure real cost and token data flows to benchmark results.

## What Was Achieved

### Core Fixes
1. **Metrics Integration**: Fixed the integration point so wrapper metrics properly flow to `.aider.results.json` files
2. **Cost Tracking**: Real costs now appear in results (e.g., $0.174 per exercise)
3. **Token Counting**: Implemented character-based estimation (3.5-4.0 chars/token) with code detection
4. **Documentation Sync**: Updated all outdated references and line numbers

### Evidence of Success
```
Before (Aug 6): cost: 0.0, tokens: 0
After (Aug 7):  cost: 0.17425725, tokens: 61/3396/264795
```

## Deliverables Completed
- âœ… Real metrics flowing end-to-end
- âœ… Cost and token tracking working
- âœ… Documentation synchronized
- âœ… Tests passing with validation

## Technical Impact
- **Scientific Validity**: Results now meaningful with real metrics
- **Comparative Analysis**: Can properly compare to aider baseline
- **Future Ready**: Foundation solid for M3 full benchmark

## Remaining Enhancements (Optional)
- Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for exact token counting (currently using estimates)
- Test error tracking with intentional failures
- Run comprehensive 50+ exercise validation

## Key Learning
Documentation lag created confusion - the fix was implemented Aug 7 but docs claimed failure based on Aug 6 state. Always update documentation immediately after fixes.

## Definition of Done âœ…
All core objectives achieved. Metrics integration working end-to-end with real cost and token data flowing to benchmark results.
