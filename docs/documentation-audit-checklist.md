# Documentation Audit Checklist

## Purpose
Systematic review of all documentation to ensure consistency, accuracy, and alignment with current implementation.

## Audit Categories

### 1. Technical Accuracy
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md**: All command examples work as documented
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md**: All file paths exist and are correct
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md**: All line number references removed or updated
- [ ] **docker/README.md**: Docker commands match actual scripts
- [ ] **tests/README.md**: Test commands are current and functional

### 2. Package Manager Consistency
- [ ] **All docs use pnpm**: No references to npm in current documentation
- [ ] **Script references**: All test scripts reference pnpm-test.sh (not npm-test.sh)
- [ ] **Installation docs**: Package installation uses pnpm commands
- [ ] **Dependencies**: package.json accurately reflects current dependencies

### 3. Implementation State Accuracy
- [ ] **Milestone status**: All milestone files reflect true completion status
- [ ] **MILESTONE_MANAGER.md**: Status matches individual milestone files
- [ ] **TECHNICAL_DEBT.md**: Current state of all debt items is accurate
- [ ] **IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md**: Timeline reflects actual completion dates

### 4. File Path Consistency
- [ ] **Docker paths**: All Dockerfile references match actual container structure
- [ ] **Script paths**: All bash script paths in docs are correct
- [ ] **Config paths**: Authentication and environment file paths are accurate
- [ ] **Output paths**: Log and result file paths match implementation

### 5. Command Validation
- [ ] **Benchmark commands**: All run-benchmark.sh examples work
- [ ] **Docker commands**: All docker.sh usage examples function
- [ ] **Test commands**: All make targets and pytest commands execute
- [ ] **Setup commands**: All authentication setup steps work

### 6. Cross-Reference Integrity
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md links**: All internal doc links resolve correctly  
- [ ] **Architecture docs**: References between architecture files are accurate
- [ ] **Tool docs**: Cross-references between cc-cli.md, cc-sdk.md, cc-models.md work
- [ ] **Milestone links**: All milestone cross-references in MILESTONE_MANAGER.md work

## Audit Process

### Phase 1: Automated Checks (30 minutes)
1. **Link validation**: Use tools to verify all internal links work
2. **File existence**: Verify all referenced files exist
3. **Command syntax**: Basic syntax checking for all code blocks
4. **Path validation**: Check all file paths exist

### Phase 2: Manual Review (2-3 hours)
1. **Content accuracy**: Read each doc section against current implementation
2. **Step-by-step validation**: Test key workflows described in documentation
3. **Consistency checking**: Compare similar information across different files
4. **Gap identification**: Find missing documentation for new features

### Phase 3: Implementation Verification (1-2 hours)
1. **Docker workflow**: Full Docker setup following documentation
2. **Benchmark execution**: Run benchmarks using documented commands
3. **Test execution**: Run all documented test procedures
4. **Authentication flow**: Verify setup process works as documented

## Documentation Priority Levels

### Critical (Fix Immediately)
- Broken links that prevent workflow completion
- Incorrect commands that cause failures
- Missing critical setup steps
- Security issues in documented procedures

### High (Fix This Week)
- Outdated package manager references (npm → pnpm)
- Incorrect file paths that confuse users
- Inconsistent milestone status information
- Missing documentation for new features

### Medium (Fix This Month)
- Minor formatting inconsistencies
- Outdated version numbers
- Non-critical cross-reference issues
- Documentation style improvements

### Low (Fix When Convenient)
- Grammar and spelling issues
- Redundant information cleanup
- Documentation structure optimization
- Historical reference cleanup

## Success Criteria

### Documentation is audit-complete when:
- [ ] All critical and high priority items resolved
- [ ] All workflows documented can be executed successfully
- [ ] New team members can follow setup documentation without assistance
- [ ] All milestone status information is accurate
- [ ] Package manager migration (npm → pnpm) is fully documented

### Audit Frequency
- **Major releases**: Complete audit before release
- **Monthly**: Quick consistency check
- **After significant changes**: Targeted audit of affected documentation
- **New team members**: Use as onboarding validation

## Notes
This checklist should be updated when new documentation is added or significant architectural changes occur.
