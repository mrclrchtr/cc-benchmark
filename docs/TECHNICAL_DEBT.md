# Technical Debt

This document tracks over-engineering and technical debt issues identified during development.

## M0 Over-Engineering Issues

### 1. Authentication System Complexity
**Issue**: 111-line setup script for what is essentially a 3-step process
- **Location**: `docker/setup-claude-auth.sh`
- **Over-engineering**: Complex token validation, fancy UI, extensive error handling
- **Simple alternative**: Standard `.env` file approach with Docker `--env-file`
- **Impact**: High maintenance overhead, confusing for users
- **Recommended fix**: Use simplified approach in `docker/docker-simple.sh`

### 2. Complex Volume Mounting
**Issue**: Custom Docker volume system instead of standard environment variables
- **Location**: `docker/docker.sh` (volume mounting), `docker/docker-entrypoint.sh` (token file reading)
- **Over-engineering**: Persistent token storage in Docker volumes when env vars are simpler
- **Simple alternative**: Direct environment variable injection via `--env-file`
- **Impact**: Additional complexity in Docker setup and debugging
- **Recommended fix**: Use `--env-file .env` instead of volume mounting

### 3. Scope Creep in Setup Script
**Issue**: Authentication script does more than authentication
- **Features added**: 
  - Docker image validation
  - Token format validation
  - API testing
  - Fancy terminal formatting
  - Detailed error messages and help text
- **Core function**: Store authentication token
- **Impact**: Script became 111 lines instead of ~10 lines
- **Recommended fix**: Separate concerns - authentication vs validation vs help

### 4. Documentation Status Inconsistency
**Issue**: Milestone status not synchronized between files
- **Location**: `docs/milestones/M0-Docker_Environment_Setup.md` vs `docs/MILESTONE_MANAGER.md`
- **Problem**: Status showed "pending" but was marked DONE in manager
- **Impact**: Confusion about project state
- **Fix**: Status synchronization (completed in M0_1)

### 5. Non-Standard Docker Practices
**Issue**: Custom solutions instead of Docker best practices
- **Examples**:
  - Custom token file system instead of environment variables
  - Complex entrypoint logic for simple authentication check
  - Volume mounting for configuration data
- **Standard approach**: Use environment variables and `--env-file`
- **Impact**: Harder to understand and maintain for Docker users

## Resolution Strategy

### Immediate (M0_1 - Completed)
- [x] Create simplified `.env` approach
- [x] Document technical debt issues
- [x] Fix documentation inconsistency
- [x] **ACTUALLY FIXED**: Replaced complex Docker scripts with simplified versions
- [x] **ACTUALLY FIXED**: Removed volume-based authentication, now uses `--env-file`
- [x] **ACTUALLY FIXED**: Simplified Docker entrypoint from 65 lines to 51 lines

### Future Cleanup (Post-M1)
- [ ] Replace complex setup script with simple instructions (setup-claude-auth.sh still exists)
- [ ] Update documentation to reference new simplified approach
- [ ] Consider removing old setup-claude-auth.sh script entirely

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with standard practices, add complexity only when needed
2. **Scope Control**: Keep scripts focused on single responsibility
3. **Documentation Sync**: Ensure status consistency across all project documents
4. **Docker Standards**: Use established Docker patterns rather than custom solutions
5. **Time Boxing**: Set strict limits to prevent gold-plating

## Philosophy for Future Development

- **Functional > Perfect**: Working simple solution beats complex perfect solution
- **Standard > Custom**: Use established patterns unless there's a compelling reason not to
- **Incremental**: Build complexity incrementally rather than upfront
- **Time-Boxed**: Set strict time limits for implementation tasks
