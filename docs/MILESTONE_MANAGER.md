# Milestone Manager

## Overview
This document tracks all project milestones and their completion status.

## Immediate Action Items (Start TODAY)

### üö® Critical: Fix Integration First (BLOCKING EVERYTHING)
M2 added metric tracking but it's BROKEN - results still show all zeros:
1. **Fix benchmark.py integration** - Make wrapper metrics flow to results JSON
2. **Verify with test run** - Ensure .aider.results.json has real metrics
3. **Find SDK metric access** - Get actual tokens/costs, not word counts
4. **Validate end-to-end** - Full flow from wrapper to results file

### Then Fix M2 Properly
Once integration works:
1. Replace word-count estimates with real SDK metrics
2. Test error tracking with actual failures
3. Run comprehensive benchmark (50+ exercises)
4. Update M2 status to DONE only when verified working

## Active Milestones

### Phase 0 - Infrastructure Setup
1. [M0-Docker_Environment_Setup.md](milestones/M0-Docker_Environment_Setup.md) - [DONE] (Docker environment with Claude Code support)
2. [M0_1-Docker_Environment_Cleanup.md](milestones/M0_1-Docker_Environment_Cleanup.md) - [DONE] (Cleanup milestone)

### Phase 1 - MVP
1. [M1-MVP_Test_the_Hypothesis.md](milestones/M1-MVP_Test_the_Hypothesis.md) - [PARTIAL] (80% pass rate achieved but with hardcoded metrics and incomplete implementation)

### Phase 2 - Technical Debt Resolution  
1. [M2-Technical_Debt_Resolution.md](milestones/M2-Technical_Debt_Resolution.md) - [PARTIAL] (Metrics code added but integration broken - results still show zeros)

### Phase 3 - Full Benchmark
_To be defined after M2 completion_

### Phase 4 - Analysis & Sharing
_To be defined after M3 completion_

## Milestone Dependencies
- M0 ‚Üí M1: Docker environment required for MVP testing
- M1 ‚Üí M2: Critical technical debt must be resolved before expansion
- M2 ‚Üí M3: Accurate implementation required for full benchmark

## Milestone Status Legend
- [ ] -> Not started
- [WIP] -> In progress
- [PARTIAL] -> Partially completed with known gaps
- [DONE] -> Completed
- [BLOCKED] -> Blocked/Waiting
- [CANCELLED] -> Cancelled

## Current Execution Strategy (UPDATED after M2 Review)

### The Situation
- M1: Achieved 80% pass rate but metrics all zeros
- M2: Added metric tracking code but **integration broken** - results STILL show zeros
- Core Problem: Wrapper calculates metrics but they never reach benchmark results

### Critical Path Forward

**Immediate Actions (Day 1)**:
1. **Debug Integration** (2-3 hours)
   - Find where benchmark.py should extract wrapper metrics
   - Fix the integration point so metrics flow to results
   - Verify with single test that JSON has real data

2. **Fix M2 Implementation** (4-6 hours)  
   - Make wrapper metrics actually work end-to-end
   - Replace word-count with real SDK metrics if possible
   - Test that all exercises generate real metrics

3. **Validate Everything** (2 hours)
   - Run 10+ exercises with full metrics
   - Confirm .aider.results.json files have real data
   - Only then update M2 to DONE

**Week 1 Reality Check**:
- Day 1-2: Fix the broken integration (M2 is NOT done)
- Day 3: Re-validate M1 with working metrics
- Day 4-5: Run comprehensive benchmark
- Day 6-7: Document real results and costs

### Why This Order?
- **Without real metrics, any testing is meaningless** - we can't compare to aider without knowing costs
- **Fixing metrics takes ~6 hours** - minimal investment for massive improvement
- **Re-running M1 tests takes ~2 hours** - quick to get real baseline
- **Maintains integrity** - no marking milestones "DONE" with fake data

### Critical Path
```
Current State: M1[PARTIAL] with fake metrics
     ‚Üì (Day 1)
Fix Metrics: M2 partial implementation
     ‚Üì (Day 2)
Complete M1: M1[DONE] with REAL metrics
     ‚Üì (Days 3-5)
Finish M2: M2[DONE] all gaps fixed
     ‚Üì
Proceed to M3: Full benchmark (unblocked)
```

### Success Gates
Before marking any milestone DONE:
- [ ] Cost tracking shows real costs (> 0)
- [ ] Token counts are real (> 0)
- [ ] Metrics validated as accurate
- [ ] Documentation synchronized
- [ ] No known critical gaps

### What NOT to Do
‚ùå Mark M1 "DONE" with fake metrics  
‚ùå Skip M2 and proceed to M3  
‚ùå Run more tests with broken implementation  
‚ùå Claim success without real data

## Notes
- Milestones are extracted from the [Implementation Plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- Each milestone follows the template in `.claude/templates/milestone-template.md`
- **M1 Status**: Achieved 80% pass rate but implementation has critical gaps (hardcoded metrics, stub implementations)
- **M2 Priority**: Technical debt resolution is blocking - must fix foundation before proceeding
- **Integrity Principle**: No milestone is "DONE" if it has known fake data or critical gaps
