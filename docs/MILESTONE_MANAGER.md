# Milestone Manager

## Overview
This document tracks all project milestones and their completion status.

## Immediate Action Items (Start TODAY)

### üö® Critical: Fix Metrics First (Day 1)
Before ANY other work, implement real metrics in cc_wrapper.py:
1. Parse actual costs from Claude Code API responses
2. Extract real token counts (input/output)
3. Validate metrics > 0 with quick test
4. This unblocks everything else

### Then Complete M1 Properly (Day 2)
Once metrics work:
1. Re-run 10 Python exercises
2. Document real costs and tokens
3. Update M1 with actual data
4. Mark M1 as truly DONE

## Active Milestones

### Phase 0 - Infrastructure Setup
1. [M0-Docker_Environment_Setup.md](milestones/M0-Docker_Environment_Setup.md) - [DONE] (Docker environment with Claude Code support)
2. [M0_1-Docker_Environment_Cleanup.md](milestones/M0_1-Docker_Environment_Cleanup.md) - [DONE] (Cleanup milestone)

### Phase 1 - MVP
1. [M1-MVP_Test_the_Hypothesis.md](milestones/M1-MVP_Test_the_Hypothesis.md) - [PARTIAL] (80% pass rate achieved but with hardcoded metrics and incomplete implementation)

### Phase 2 - Technical Debt Resolution  
1. [M2-Technical_Debt_Resolution.md](milestones/M2-Technical_Debt_Resolution.md) - [WIP] (Starting with critical metrics fix)

### Phase 3 - Full Benchmark
_To be defined after M2 completion_

### Phase 4 - Analysis & Sharing
_To be defined after M3 completion_

## Milestone Dependencies
- M0 ‚Üí M1: Docker environment required for MVP testing
- M1 ‚Üí M2: Critical technical debt must be resolved before expansion
- M2 ‚Üí M3: Accurate implementation required for full benchmark

## Milestone Status Legend
- [ ] -> Not started
- [WIP] -> In progress
- [PARTIAL] -> Partially completed with known gaps
- [DONE] -> Completed
- [BLOCKED] -> Blocked/Waiting
- [CANCELLED] -> Cancelled

## Current Execution Strategy (Critical Decision)

### The Situation
M1 achieved its core goal (80% pass rate) but with fake metrics (cost/tokens hardcoded to 0). This makes the results scientifically meaningless and blocks all future work.

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid M2‚ÜíM1 Completion

**Week 1 Execution Plan:**
1. **Day 1 (Immediate)**: Start M2 - Fix critical metrics in cc_wrapper.py (4-6 hours)
   - Implement real cost tracking
   - Add actual token counting
   - Quick validation that metrics > 0

2. **Day 2**: Complete M1 properly with real metrics (4 hours)
   - Re-run 10 Python exercises WITH real metrics
   - Document actual costs and token usage
   - Update M1 milestone with real data
   - Mark M1 as DONE (truly complete)

3. **Days 3-5**: Continue M2 - remaining fixes
   - Complete error handling
   - Fix documentation inconsistencies
   - Run comprehensive validation (50+ exercises)

### Why This Order?
- **Without real metrics, any testing is meaningless** - we can't compare to aider without knowing costs
- **Fixing metrics takes ~6 hours** - minimal investment for massive improvement
- **Re-running M1 tests takes ~2 hours** - quick to get real baseline
- **Maintains integrity** - no marking milestones "DONE" with fake data

### Critical Path
```
Current State: M1[PARTIAL] with fake metrics
     ‚Üì (Day 1)
Fix Metrics: M2 partial implementation
     ‚Üì (Day 2)
Complete M1: M1[DONE] with REAL metrics
     ‚Üì (Days 3-5)
Finish M2: M2[DONE] all gaps fixed
     ‚Üì
Proceed to M3: Full benchmark (unblocked)
```

### Success Gates
Before marking any milestone DONE:
- [ ] Cost tracking shows real costs (> 0)
- [ ] Token counts are real (> 0)
- [ ] Metrics validated as accurate
- [ ] Documentation synchronized
- [ ] No known critical gaps

### What NOT to Do
‚ùå Mark M1 "DONE" with fake metrics  
‚ùå Skip M2 and proceed to M3  
‚ùå Run more tests with broken implementation  
‚ùå Claim success without real data

## Notes
- Milestones are extracted from the [Implementation Plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- Each milestone follows the template in `.claude/templates/milestone-template.md`
- **M1 Status**: Achieved 80% pass rate but implementation has critical gaps (hardcoded metrics, stub implementations)
- **M2 Priority**: Technical debt resolution is blocking - must fix foundation before proceeding
- **Integrity Principle**: No milestone is "DONE" if it has known fake data or critical gaps
