# Milestone Manager

## Overview
This document tracks all project milestones and their completion status.

## Active Milestones

### Phase 0 - Infrastructure Setup
1. [M0-Docker_Environment_Setup.md](milestones/M0-Docker_Environment_Setup.md) - [DONE] (Docker environment with Claude Code support)
2. [M0_1-Docker_Environment_Cleanup.md](milestones/M0_1-Docker_Environment_Cleanup.md) - [ ] (Cleanup milestone)

### Phase 1 - MVP
1. [M1-MVP_Test_the_Hypothesis.md](milestones/M1-MVP_Test_the_Hypothesis.md) - [WIP] (Integration complete, MVP validation incomplete - only 2/10 exercises tested)

### Phase 2 - Full Benchmark
_To be defined after M1 completion_

### Phase 3 - Analysis & Sharing
_To be defined after M2 completion_

## Milestone Dependencies
- M0 → M1: Docker environment required for MVP testing
- M1 → M2: MVP results determine full benchmark approach

## Milestone Status Legend
- [ ] -> Not started
- [WIP] -> In progress
- [DONE] -> Completed
- [BLOCKED] -> Blocked/Waiting
- [CANCELLED] -> Cancelled

## Notes
- Milestones are extracted from the [Implementation Plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- Each milestone follows the template in `.claude/templates/milestone-template.md`
- **M1 Success**: Successfully validated Claude Code integration with 100% pass rate on Python exercises, exceeding aider's 85% baseline
