# Milestone Manager

## Overview
This document tracks all project milestones and their completion status.

## Current Status

### Completed Milestones
- **M0**: Docker Environment Setup - [DONE]
- **M0_1**: Docker Environment Cleanup - [DONE]
- **M1**: MVP Test the Hypothesis - [PARTIAL] (80% pass rate achieved)
- **M2**: Technical Debt Resolution - [DONE] (Metrics integration working)

### Next Steps
1. **Re-run M1 with validated metrics** to establish baseline
2. **Plan M3**: Full benchmark implementation
3. **Execute comprehensive testing** across multiple languages

## Active Milestones

### Phase 0 - Infrastructure Setup
1. [M0-Docker_Environment_Setup.md](milestones/M0-Docker_Environment_Setup.md) - [DONE]
2. [M0_1-Docker_Environment_Cleanup.md](milestones/M0_1-Docker_Environment_Cleanup.md) - [DONE]

### Phase 1 - MVP
1. [M1-MVP_Test_the_Hypothesis.md](milestones/M1-MVP_Test_the_Hypothesis.md) - [PARTIAL] (80% pass rate, needs re-run with metrics)

### Phase 2 - Technical Debt Resolution  
1. [M2-Technical_Debt_Resolution.md](milestones/M2-Technical_Debt_Resolution.md) - [DONE]

### Phase 3 - Full Benchmark
_To be defined after M1 re-validation_

### Phase 4 - Analysis & Sharing
_To be defined after M3 completion_

## Milestone Dependencies
- M0 → M1: Docker environment required for MVP testing
- M1 → M2: Technical debt resolved before expansion
- M2 → M3: Accurate metrics required for full benchmark
- M3 → M4: Full data needed for analysis

## Status Legend
- [ ] → Not started
- [WIP] → In progress
- [PARTIAL] → Partially completed with known gaps
- [DONE] → Completed
- [BLOCKED] → Blocked/Waiting
- [CANCELLED] → Cancelled

## Success Criteria
All milestones must meet these criteria before marked DONE:
- ✅ Core functionality working
- ✅ Metrics validated (cost > 0, tokens > 0)
- ✅ Documentation synchronized
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ No critical gaps

## Notes
- Milestones are extracted from the [Implementation Plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- Each milestone follows the template in `.claude/templates/milestone-template.md`
- **Integrity Principle**: No milestone is "DONE" if it has known critical gaps
