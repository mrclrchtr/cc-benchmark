# Claude Code Benchmark Vision (cc-benchmark)

## Core Hypothesis

Claude Code outperforms aider at solving Exercism programming exercises. This project will quantitatively prove or disprove this hypothesis.

## What This Actually Is

A personal benchmarking tool that:
- Forks aider's proven benchmark infrastructure (MIT licensed)
- Runs identical Exercism exercises through Claude Code
- Produces quantitative comparisons between Claude Code and aider

## Why Build This

- **Personal validation**: I believe Claude Code is better and want data to support/refute this
- **No existing comparison**: Despite both tools being popular, no head-to-head comparison exists
- **Community value**: Other developers choosing between aider and Claude Code need objective data

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metric
- **Pass rate**: Beat aider's 85% pass rate as the key validation benchmark

### Secondary Metrics
- **Iterations to solution**: Number of attempts needed to pass all tests
- **Code quality**: Cyclomatic complexity, line count, readability scores
- **Failure analysis**: Categories of exercises where each tool struggles
- **Performance patterns**: Identify specific exercise types where Claude Code excels or underperforms

## Technical Foundation

### Proven Benchmark Infrastructure
- Built on aider's established polyglot-benchmark framework with validated Exercism exercises
- Leverages existing Docker-based multi-language testing environment
- Reuses 95% of existing infrastructure with minimal integration changes

### Claude Code Integration Advantages
- Official Python SDK provides structured, reliable programmatic access
- Built-in session management eliminates complex state handling
- Typed responses and error handling reduce integration complexity
- Designed for automation with non-interactive modes

## Technical Approach

### Minimal Integration Strategy
- Single integration point replacement in existing benchmark framework
- Preserve all existing test infrastructure and exercise formats
- Maintain Docker-based isolation for identical testing conditions
- Direct result comparison using same scoring methodology

### Rapid Validation Timeline
- MVP validation achievable in 2-3 days for Python exercises
- Full multi-language benchmark completable within one week
- Quick hypothesis testing rather than extensive development project

## Scope Boundaries

### What This IS
- A benchmarking tool for Exercism exercises
- A quantitative comparison framework
- A personal project with community benefit

### What This IS NOT
- A comprehensive AI coding assistant evaluation
- A real-world development workflow test
- A sponsored or official comparison

## v1.0 Definition of Done

### MVP Validation (Python Focus)
1. Beat aider's 85% pass rate on Python exercises
2. Successfully process all exercises from aider's polyglot-benchmark
3. Generate direct comparison data using identical scoring methodology

### Full Benchmark Completion
1. Multi-language validation across all supported exercise types
2. Reproducible results with detailed failure analysis
3. Shareable comparison report with statistical significance

## Risk Acknowledgments

- **Bias risk**: I expect Claude Code to win. Results will be published regardless of outcome.
- **Scope risk**: Exercism exercises may not represent real-world coding tasks
- **Integration risk**: Lower than initially expected due to SDK reliability and minimal changes required
- **Cost risk**: Rapid validation timeline keeps API costs within acceptable personal project limits
- **Reproducibility risk**: Results depend on Claude Code's consistency across test runs

## Future Considerations

Once baseline comparison is established:
- Test different Claude Code configurations
- Expand to non-Exercism benchmarks if results prove interesting
- Open source for community contributions and validation

## Bottom Line

This is a personal project to quantify my belief that Claude Code > aider at code generation tasks. The benchmarking framework will be objective, even if my hypothesis isn't. Results will be published whether they confirm or refute my expectations.
